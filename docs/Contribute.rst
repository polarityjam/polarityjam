How can I become a contributor?

Option A - You are experienced in python programming or R programming:
Fork the project, implement your idea and make a Pull request.
Together we can solve remaining issues (if any)

Clone PolarityJaM repository from source as ::

    git clone https://github.com/polarityjam/polarityjam
    cd polarityjam
    git checkout main

Optionally install `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_.
This will ensure that the pushed code passes the linting steps::

    pre-commit install

Although the last step is not necessary, it is highly recommended, as it will help you to pass the linting step.
