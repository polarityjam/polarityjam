Web-App
========

We provide a simple means for statistical analysis of circular data that supports both exploratory analysis and the generation of graphs for publication. The App is based on the R Shiny inteface and can be started locally on you computer or on an web service provided by the Max-Delbr√ºck-Center for MolecularMedicine.

.. note::
    This is still under development. Please come back later!

Circular statistics
-------------------

The App provides a set of functions for the analysis and plotting of circular data. Generally circular data are data that can be mapped on a circle.
Besides cellular polarity, examples outside the biology are the direction of the wind, the direction of the magnetic field.

We generally distinguish between directional, axial and linear data. Directional data are data with values in [0,2 &pi ] or 0 to 360, in radians or degrees, respectively.
Axial data are data with values [0, &pi] or 0 to 180 in degrees. Linear data is not circular data it is supported by the app
to plot non-circular data and compute circular-linear correlations.

The computation of the polarity index is based on the following formula:

.. math::

    PI = \sqrt{ \left(\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \cos(\theta_i) \right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \sin(\theta_i)\right)^2 }
